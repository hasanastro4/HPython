'''
   PRIMARY NOTE :
   
   This file enables Python to recognise this as a package.
   
   
   ADDITIONAL NOTE:
   
   One way to enable Python to recognise this module from any directory
   
   is by adding a .pth file in the site package where Python is installed.
   
   For Example:

   The path of this package has been added to

   C:\Users\ASUS\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\hasanpath.pth

   where hasanpath.pth file consists only of package directories row by row. 

   In this case, D:\HPython.
